# Strategy Research Agent

Research, design, and implement new search strategies or optimizations for Extremal.
This skill is used by the orchestrator when the system decides research is more valuable than running experiments.

## Goal

Improve the quality of graphs found by workers, measured by:
1. Better leaderboard scores (fewer 4-cliques, better triangle balance, higher symmetry)
2. Higher admission rate (more graphs beating the threshold)
3. Faster discovery of valid graphs

## Inputs

Before starting, read these files to understand current state:

1. `experiments/agent/strategies.json` — Registry of known strategies, their performance, and ideas to try
2. `experiments/agent/findings.json` — Validated experimental findings
3. `experiments/agent/journal.md` — Recent experiment history and outcomes
4. `CLAUDE.md` — Full architecture and scoring system docs

## Process

### 1. Assess

Read the registry's `ideas` list and `strategies` list. Ask:
- Which ideas are highest priority and lowest effort?
- What's the current performance ceiling? (check top leaderboard scores)
- Are there diminishing returns on current approaches? (check recent journal entries)
- What's the biggest bottleneck: finding valid graphs, or scoring quality of valid graphs?

### 2. Choose

Pick ONE idea to implement. Prefer:
- High priority + low effort first (quick wins)
- Ideas that address the current bottleneck
- Ideas that are complementary to existing validated strategies (not replacements)

If no existing idea fits, propose a new one based on:
- Patterns in the codebase (read strategy implementations)
- The scoring system structure (what actually differentiates top graphs)
- Mathematical properties of Ramsey graphs

### 3. Implement

Write the code. Key files:

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| New strategy | `crates/extremal-strategies/src/<name>.rs` |
| Strategy registration | `crates/extremal-strategies/src/lib.rs` |
| Config presets | `experiments/agent/strategies.json` (add to strategies list) |
| Engine changes | `crates/extremal-worker-core/src/engine.rs` |
| Polish improvements | `crates/extremal-strategies/src/polish.rs` |
| Worker CLI flags | `crates/extremal-worker/src/main.rs` |

Follow existing patterns:
- Implement `SearchStrategy` trait (see `tree2.rs` or `tabu.rs`)
- Use `violation_delta` for incremental scoring
- Use `canonical_form` + CID for dedup
- Report discoveries via `observer.on_discovery()`
- Add tests (at minimum: R(3,3)/n=5 sanity check)

### 4. Validate

```bash
./run ci    # Must pass: fmt + clippy + all tests
```

If adding a new strategy, also run the experiment harness:
```bash
cargo run -p extremal-experiments --release -- compare --n 25 --budget 100000 --seeds 5
```

### 5. Commit

Commit on the current branch (do NOT create a new branch):
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: <description of strategy change>"
```

### 6. Update Registry

Update `experiments/agent/strategies.json`:
- If new strategy: add to `strategies` list with `status: "untested"`
- If new config preset: add to `strategies` list with `status: "untested"`
- Move the implemented idea from `ideas` to `strategies`
- Add any new ideas discovered during implementation to `ideas`

### 7. Report

Output a summary:
```
## Strategy Research Report

**Implemented**: [id] — [description]
**Commit**: [hash]
**Files changed**: [list]
**Status**: untested — ready for experiment validation
**Expected impact**: [what should improve and why]
**How to test**: [specific experiment config or fleet params]
```

## Guidelines

- **One change per research cycle**. Don't try to do everything at once.
- **Smallest viable change**. A config preset is easier than a new strategy. An engine tweak is easier than a new algorithm.
- **Build on what works**. The tree2 + deep polish pipeline is validated. Extend it, don't replace it.
- **Measure before and after**. Every change should have a clear metric to evaluate.
- **Stay on current branch**. The orchestrator expects commits on the active branch.
- **Don't break existing tests**. `./run ci` must pass after your changes.

## Anti-patterns

- Don't implement multiple ideas in one cycle
- Don't refactor existing strategies (focus on new capabilities)
- Don't change scoring or server code (only worker/strategy code)
- Don't add ideas to the registry without implementing something first
- Don't skip the CI validation step
